## The game description
A simple 3d hunting game.

First person POV character holds a weapon against the wildlife infront and aims upon the appearing creatures.
Every creature has a unique behaviour and appearance. Each one of them can either run away or try to attack the character, so don't scare them if you're not sure about your aim!
Your goal as a player is to eliminate ALL of the creatures in order to finish the level and receive the reward.
If something didn't go as planned and one or more creatures managed to run away from you and/or came close enough to kill you,
you would lose and have to restart the level.

The game also offers an in-game progress such as new levels and new hunting environment along with personal customizations.

Have a good one!


The creatures list:
(Starts of as simple geometric shapes, may evolve into something more realistic)

All of the creatures react only to the sound of the weapon.

Passive (Running away):
1. Ball - Coward. Fast. Moves alone. Takes one shot to eliminate.
2. Cube - Coward. Slow. Moves in pairs. Takes one shot to eliminate.

Active (Attacking):
1. Pyramid - Fast. Moves alone. Takes two shots to eliminate.
2. Star polyhedron - Slow. Moves in groups of 3-4 allies. Takes one shot to eliminate.

## Future development ideas:
